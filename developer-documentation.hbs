# Developer Documentation

This documentation includes the implementation details of Auto Encrypt Localhost and is intended to aid you if you’re trying to improve, debug, or get a deeper understanding of Auto Encrypt.

If you just want to use Auto Encrypt Localhost, please see the public API, as documented in the [README](readme.md).

## Requirements

Auto Encrypt Localhost is supported on:

  - __Node:__ LTS (currently 14.16.0).
  - __ECMAScript:__ [ES2019](https://node.green/#ES2019)

## Overview of relationships

![Dependency relationship diagram for Auto Correct](artefacts/dependency-graph.svg)

__Not shown (for clarity):__ third-party Node modules, the `util` namespace with helper modules – for logging, error handling, and an async `forEach` implementation – and the `typedefs` namespace with JSDoc type definitions.

Generated using [dependency cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser).

To run dependency cruiser, you will need to [install Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/).

## How it works in more detail

Auto Encrypt Localhost is a Node.js wrapper for [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/) that, at the npm post-install stage:

  - Downloads and uses correct mkcert release binary for you machine on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

  - Automatically installs the _certutil_ (nss) dependency on Linux on systems with apt, pacman, yum (untested) and  and on macOS if you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) or [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) (untested).

  - Creates a root Certificate Authority.

  - Creates locally-trusted TLS certificates for localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1.

You can use these certificates for local development without triggering self-signed certificate errors.

At runtime, you can use the library to create your HTTPS servers instead of using the built-in Node.js `https` module.

For more details on how Auto Encrypt Localhost works behind the scenes, please [see the mkcert README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/blob/master/README.md).
